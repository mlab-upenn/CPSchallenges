	abstract = "Background Inappropriate therapy for supraventricular arrhythmias remains a significant source of morbidity in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) recipients. Objective The Rhythm \{ID\} Goes Head to Head Trial (RIGHT) was designed to compare rhythm discrimination and inappropriate therapies among patients with \{ICDs\} from 2 manufacturers. Methods Patients with standard \{ICD\} indications were randomized to receive a Guidant \{VITALITY\} 2 with Rhythm \{ID\} or selective Medtronic pulse generators using the Enhanced \{PR\} Logic or Wavelet discrimination algorithms. A single- or dual-chamber device was implanted based on clinical indications and programmed in 2 detection zones with detection enhancements enabled for rates between 150 and 200 bpm. Algorithm performance was compared between randomization groups, stratified by single or dual chamber, for the primary end point of first inappropriate therapy (shock or antitachycardia pacing) for supraventricular arrhythmias. Results There were 1962 patients enrolled and followed for 18.3 Â± 9.2 months, with no difference in all-cause mortality between groups. There were 3973 treated episodes where electrograms were available and adjudicated. The primary end point of inappropriate therapy occurred in 246 of 985 \{VITALITY\} 2 patients vs 187 of 977 specific Medtronic \{ICD\} patients (hazard ratio = 1.34; confidence interval = 1.11â1.62; P = .003). Differences in inappropriate therapy were confined to single-chamber ICDs. Inappropriate shocks were more frequent in \{VITALITY\} 2 \{ICDs\} (hazard ratio = 1.63; confidence interval = 1.29â2.06; P &lt; .001), with most therapies and performance differences occurring at slower rhythms (rates &lt; 175 bpm). Conclusion Rhythm discrimination performed better in the specific Medtronic than in \{VITALITY\} 2 \{ICDs\} evaluated, particularly for single-chamber devices. Inappropriate therapies, and differences in performance, may be reduced with the use of rate cutoff above 175 bpm. "
